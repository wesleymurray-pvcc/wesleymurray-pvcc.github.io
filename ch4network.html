    <h1>Operating Systems Terminology</h1>
    <table>
        
    <ul>
        <h2>Network Classification</h2>
            <li>LAN: Local Area Network, consists of a collection of computers in a single building or building complex.</li>
            <li>MAN: Metropolitan Area Network, a network of intermediate such as one spanning a local community.</li>
            <li>WAN: Wide Area Network, links machines over greater distances between cities, and countries etc.</li>
    </ul>    
    <ul>
        <h2>Network Models</h2>
        <li>Bus Network: Common communication line called bus connects machines.</li>
        <li>Star Network: One machine serves as central focus point to which all other machines are connected.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h2>Protocols</h2>
        <li>CSMA/CD Ethernet: Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Detection. Right to transmit message is governed by protocols.</li>
        <li>CSMA/CA Wifi: Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance. Trying to avoid data collision rather than detect it. </li>
    </ul>    
    <ul>
        <h2>Combining Networks</h2>
        <li>repeater: Device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses.</li>
        <li>bridge: Like a repeater but more complex, it seeks a destination and will not send message across unless it has defined destination.</li>
        <li>switch: Bridge with multiple connection allowing it to connect several buses rather than just two.</li>
        <li>router: Connect to form an internet, special purpose computers used for forwarding messages.</li>
        <li>gateway: Point at which one network is linked to the internet.</li>
    </ul>    
    <ul>
        <h2>p2p: peer-to-peer</h2>
        <li>distributed systems: Software units that execute as processes on different computers.</li>
        <li>cloud computing: Huge pools of shared computers on the network that can be allocated for use by clients as needed.</li>
    </ul>  
    <ul>
        <h2>Internet Addressing</h2>
        <li>Tier 1: High speed, high capactity, international WANs considered the backbone of the internet.</li>
        <li>Tier 2: More regional in scope and less potent in their capablilies.</li>
        <li>Tier 3: Independent, intranets, generally run by a cable of phone company.</li>
    </ul>    
    <ul>
        <h2>Ip Address</h2>
        <li>ICANN: Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, non-profit corporation established to coordinate the Interet's operation.</li> 
        <li><a href = "https://www.icann.org/">ICANN</a></li>
        <li>DNS: Internet wide directory system based around domain names.</li>
        <li>TLD: Top-level domain, domain names charcterized by suffixes.</li>
        <li>Country-code TLDs: Domain names for countries.</li> 
        <li><a href = "https://www.worldstandards.eu/other/tlds/">Country-code Domain Names</a></li>
    </ul>    
    <ul>
        <h2>Internet Protocols</h2>
        <li>FTP: File Transfer Protocol, application for accessing another computer from a great distance using the Telnet protocol.</li>
        <li>HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, a more sophisticate file transfer protocol generally in use today.</li>
        <li>SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, defines a way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to the other.</li>
    </ul>  
    <ul>
        <h2>World Wide Web</h2>
        <li>URL: Uniform Resource Locator, unique address given to a document on the internet so it may be retrieved.</li>
        <li>client-side activities: Activities performed by the client like filling out a form.</li>
        <li>server-side activities: Activities performed by the server.</li>
    </ul>    
    <ul>
        <h2>Internet four-layer software</h2>
        <li>application layer: Consists of those software units such as clients and servers that use Internet communication to carry out their tasks.</li>
        <li>transport layer: Used by application layer to send and receive messages over the Internet like a shipping company sends packages.</li>
        <li>network layer: Decides which directiion a packet should be sent at each step along the packet's path through the Internet.</li>
        <li>link layer: Has the responsibility to transfer the packet.</li>
    </ul>    
    <ul>
        <h2>Internet is:</h2>
        <li>packet switching network: The Internet in which digital data is sent by breaking the data into blocks of bits called packets, which contain both the data being transmitted and control information for routing the data.</li>
        <li>fault tolerant: Refers to the system's ability to continue operating deespite failure or malfunctions.</li>
        <li>redundant: Process of providing multiple paths for traffic so that data can keep flowing even in the event of a failure.</li>
    </ul>    
    <ul>
        <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
        <li>malware: Malicious software that attacks a computer system and its contents often to steal information or disrupt essential functions.</li>
        <li>virus: Software that infects a computer by inserting itself into programs that already reside in the machine.</li>
        <li>worm: An autonomous program that transfers itself through a network, taking up residence in computers and forwarding copies of itself to other computers.</li>
        <li>Trojan horse: A program that enters a computer system disguised as a desirable program, such as a game or useful utility package that is willingly imported by the victim.</li>
        <li>spyware: Software that collects information about activities at the computer on which it resides and reports that information back to the instigator of the attack.</li>
        <li>phishing: Technique of obtain information explicitly by simply asking for it, new version of the telephone con.</li>
        <li>DDos attack: Distributed denial of service attack is an attack generated by generating a large number of messages in a short period of time to overwhelm the servers, these attacks are generated from numerous unsuspecting computers.</li>
    </ul>    
    <ul>
        <h2>Protection</h2>
        <li>firewall: Traffic is filtered through this point to prevent infiltration.</li>
        <li>spam filter: Firewalls designed to block unwanted emails.</li>
        <li>proxy server: Software unit that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server with the goal of shielding the client from adverse actions of the server.</li>
        <li>antivirus software: Used to detect and remove the presence of known viruses and other infections.</li>
        <li>cryptography: Study of sending and receiving messages ercurely in the presence of adversaries.</li>
        <li>public key encryption: Involves techniques by which the encryption and decryption algorithms are known, and one of the keys is known, but the encoded message remains secure.</li>
