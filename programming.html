    <h1>Chapter 5: Programming Algorithms & Software Testing</h1>
    <table>
        
    <ul>
        <h2>Phases of computer program development:</h2>
            <li>Phase 1: Understand the problem</li>
            <p><li>Phase 2: Design an algorithm to solve the problems</li></p>
            <p><li>Phase 3: Write the program code in appropriate language based on the algorithm</li></p>
            <p><li>Phase 4: Enter the program and save</li></p>
            <p><li>Phase 5: Execute the Program</li></p>
            <p><li>Phase 6: Test the program, find errors and debut, then retest</li></p>
            <p><li>Phase 7: Document and evaluate the program</li></p>
    </ul>    
    <ul>
        <h2>Programming Structures:</h2>
        <li>Sequential structure: Top-down execution</li>
        <p><li>Decision structures: if/then/else</li></p>
        <p><li>Iterative (Looping):</li></p>
        <ul>while loop: continue looping as long as something is true</ul>
        <ul>repeat/until loop: continue looping until something is true</ul>
        <ul>for loop: loop a given number of times</ul>
        <p><li>Recursive structures:</li></p>
        <ul>Repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself</ul>
        <ul>Repetition continues until:</ul>
        <ul>degenerative case, which is a termination condition is met</ul>
        <ul>(degenerative case is also called a "base case")</ul>

    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h2>Two classic programming/database problems</h2>
        <li>Sorting: Descending order/Ascending order</li>
        <p><ul>Sorting numbers</ul></p>
        <ul>Sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values)</ul>
        <p><li>Searching: find specific data that meet a certain criteria</li></p>
        <ul>In Database:</ul>
        <ul>Filters: temporary search</ul>
        <ul>Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated</ul>
        <p><li>Two popular search techniques:</li></p>
        <p><ul>Sequential search: search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time</ul></p>
        <ul>Binary Search:</ul>
        <ul>only works if data is SORTED first</ul>
        <ul>start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.</ul>
    </ul>    
    
    <ul>
        <h2>Two classic program goals:</h2>
        <li>Efficiency: Program takes minimal time and/or resources</li>
        <p><li>Correctness: Program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions</li></p>
    </ul>  
    <ul>
        <h2>Software testing and verification</h2>
        <li>Kinds of tests:</li>
        <p>Acceptance testing: Verifying whether the whole system works as intended.</p>
        <p>Integration testing: Ensuring that software components or functions operate together.</p>
        <p>Unit testing: Validating that each software unit runs as expected.</p>
        <p>Functional testing: Checking functions by emulating business scenarios, based on funtional requirements.</p>
        <p>Performance testing: Testing how the software runs under different workloads.</p>
        <p>Regression testing: Checking whether new features break or degrade functionality.</p>
        <p>Stress testing: Testing how much strain the system can take before it fails.</p>
        <p>Usability testing: Validating how well a customer can use a system or web application to complete a task.</p>
       
    </ul>    
    <ul>
        <h3>Software testing is done to detect:</h3>
        <li>Architectural flaws</li>
        <li>Poor design decisions</li>
        <li>Invalid or incorrect functionality</li>
        <li>Security vulnerabilities</li>
        <li>Scalability issues</li>
    </ul>    
    <ul>
        <h3>Testing best practices:</h3>
        <p>Continuous testing: Project teams test each build as it becomes available.</p>
        <p>Configuration management: Organizations centrally maintain test assets and track what software builds to test.</p>
        <p>Service virtualization: Simulates the services and systems that are missing or not yet completed.</p>
        <p>Defect or "bug tracking": Monitoring defects is important to both testing and development teams for measuring and improving quality.</p>
        <p>Metrics and reporting: Reporting and analytics enable team member to share status, goals and test results.</p>
    </ul>
